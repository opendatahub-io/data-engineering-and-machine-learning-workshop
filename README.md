# Data Engineering and Machine Learning on OpenShift

In this hands-on lab, attendees will understand how to use OpenShift Container Platform, OpenShift Container Storage, and the Open Data Hub to provide self-service provisioning of data processing, analytics, and machine learning services to organizations.

This repository contains the materials and resources you need for a workshop.

    2. [`templates`](./deploy/templates) OpenShift templates required to deploy the workshop, as well as any Ansible roles and playbooks.

* a [`slides`](./slides) folder containing:
    1. [`rendered`](./slides/rendered) [data-engineering-and-machine-learning-workshop.pdf](./slides/rendered/data-engineering-and-machine-learning-workshop.pdf) file of the slides, as well as any rendered videos which are to be shown in the workshop.
    2. [`source`](./slides/source) [data-engineering-and-machine-learning-workshop.pptx](./slides/source/data-engineering-and-machine-learning-workshop.pptx) source file for the slides.
